# Scala-99
### Overview
I want to learn Scala for a long time for a lot of reasons. One reason is that I am very interested in exploring functional programming and its integration with JVM makes it so powerful that it can do either big data processing, machine learning or backend work.

I recently found [this link](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/). After having a quick overview of it. I think it is a good start as it gives a progressive way to learn Scala from nothing.

### Tips
For the easier problems here, just don't have a problem-solving oriented mentality and think more about how to use Scala's way to solve the problem. Otherwise, there would no difference from doing imperative programming like Java.

### Todo
- Add more questions to the repo
- Add test cases for each problem and automate the testing if its possible, so future Scala learner could benefit from this project (hopefully)
